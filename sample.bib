	abstract = {The Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research in Astrophysics (ASTERIA) was deployed from the International Space Station (ISS) on 20 November 2017, beginning a technology demonstration and opportunistic science mission to advance the state of the art in nanosatellite performance for astrophysical observations. The goal of ASTERIA is to achieve arcsecond-level line-of-sight pointing error and highly stable focal plane temperature control. These capabilities enable precision photometryâi.e. the careful measurement of stellar brightness over timeâwhich in turn allows investigation of astrophysical phenomena such as transiting exoplanets. By the end of the 90-day prime mission, ASTERIA had achieved line-of-sight pointing stability of approximately 0.5 arcseconds root mean square (RMS) over 20-minute observations, pointing repeatability of 1 milliarcsecond RMS from one observation to the next, and focal plane temperature stability better than Â±0.01 K over 20-minute observations. This paper presents an overview of the ASTERIA flight and ground system, summarizes the pre-delivery test campaign, and discusses the on-orbit performance obtained by the pointing and thermal control subsystems. We also describe the process for planning opportunistic science observations and present lessons learned from development and operations. Having successfully operated for over 200 days as of this writing, ASTERIA is currently in an extended mission to observe nearby bright stars for transiting exoplanets.},

	abstract = {Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) Deformable Mirrors (DMs) enable precise wavefront control for optical systems. This technology can be used to meet the extreme wavefront control requirements for high contrast imaging of exoplanets with coronagraph instruments. MEMS DM technology is being demonstrated and developed in preparation for future exoplanet high contrast imaging space telescopes, including the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission which supported the development of a 2040 actuator MEMS DM. In this paper, we discuss ground testing results and several projects which demonstrate the operation of MEMS DMs in the space environment. The missions include the Planet Imaging Concept Testbed Using a Recoverable Experiment (PICTURE) sounding rocket (launched 2011), the Planet Imaging Coronagraphic Technology Using a Reconfigurable Experimental Base (PICTURE-B) sounding rocket (launched 2015), the Planetary Imaging Concept Testbed Using a Recoverable Experiment - Coronagraph (PICTURE-C) high altitude balloon (expected launch 2019), the High Contrast Imaging Balloon System (HiCIBaS) high altitude balloon (launched 2018), and the Deformable Mirror Demonstration Mission (DeMi) CubeSat mission (expected launch late 2019). We summarize results from the previously flown missions and objectives for the missions that are next on the pad. PICTURE had technical difficulties with the sounding rocket telemetry system. PICTURE-B demonstrated functionality at \&gt;100 km altitude after the payload experienced 12-g RMS (Vehicle Level 2) test and sounding rocket launch loads. The PICTURE-C balloon aims to demonstrate     10  - 7      contrast using a vector vortex coronagraph, image plane wavefront sensor, and a 952 actuator MEMS DM. The HiClBaS flight experienced a DM cabling issue, but the 37-segment hexagonal piston-tip-tilt DM is operational post-flight. The DeMi mission aims to demonstrate wavefront control to a precision of less than 100 nm RMS in space with a 140 actuator MEMS DM.},
